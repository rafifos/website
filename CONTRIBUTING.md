# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Requesting new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix

## We Develop with GitHub

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](./LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs and request new features and using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/rafifos/website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rafifos/website/issues/new?assignees=rafifos&labels=bug&template=BUG_REPORT.md&title=); it's that easy!

We also use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Request new features by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rafifos/website/issues/new?assignees=rafifos&labels=enhancement&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md&title=); again, it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` to make sure your code passes our coding style.

## License
